## SOND: Volunteer and Events Tracker

## Description

  	The intent of this application is to enable Special Olympics North Dakota and its volunteers to track their involvement with SOND events.  This application will gather and collate volunteer data and also record volunteer hours by event.  Data will be exported for interaction with Excel.

    This application was built by Lance Gagner, Zach Mead, Cody Njos and Jon Kranzler for Special Olympics North Dakota on occasion of their client work as a part of their involvement in Emerging Digital Academy's Conway Cohort.


## Usage

    For volunteers: click on "register" and fill out the registration form.  Once logged in and registered you will be able to review the events that SOND hosts.  To sign up for an event click on the “join” button and you will be added to the list of volunteers for that event.  If your schedule changes clicking on “can’t make it” will remove you from that list.

    For officers (meaning those who can create events) you will have to register as above and get authorization from a SOND admin.  Once that is completed you will have access to the “Add Event” when logged in.  Here you will find a form to fill out with various data about your event.  All fields are required excepting “special instructions” and. “Image URL”.  “Image URL” can be a link to any web-based image, if left blank it will default to SOND’s logo.  Once you have filled out your event’s information clicking on “submit” will add it to the event list.  “Clear Fields” will erase everything in this form should you want to start over.
